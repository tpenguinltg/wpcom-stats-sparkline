# wpcom-stats-sparkline.user.js

[WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) has removed the view stats sparkline that was previously in the admin bar. Restoring it is [under consideration](https://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/new-admin-bar-feedback?replies=12#post-2824387), but until it is, this user script restores it.

## Installation
If you don't already have one, install [a browser extension](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts) that allows you to run user scripts. Then visit the URL below:
